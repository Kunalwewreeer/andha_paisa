This task is dedicated to understanding what linear regression and gradient descent is. 
So alas kam karo aur kaam pe lago
The website https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~swaprava/cs217240_2024.html comprises of some
good content for regression and further machine learning concepts. For rigorousity, Book
"Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction" is nice but not recommended as it is too
complex. 
YouTube is a great resources for learning linear regression and videos such as 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtsRRUddV2s will help you a lot. The channel named StatQuest
is fantastic and will give you a very intuitive perspective about the concepts. So check them 
out. Reading1 and Reading2 is expected to be understood. The coding activity is 
based on that. Again YouTube is great for gradient descent, so look up any video suited to
you. For implementing the lab go through the documentation as stated in the file.
