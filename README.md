# andha_paisa
A repository aimed to convert the dream of live deployement into a reality (to yolo away our life savings lol). 
This repository contains the resources and code to help you to collaboratively build a comprehensive automated trading system, and to assist us in testing as many ideas as possible proposed by the participants in this project.

## Getting Started
### YouTube Overview

   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   Install the dependencies based on the libraries used in the code.

### Running the Project

The project will be run in stages. stage_2 and stage_3 code will only be visible after the tasks in previous stages are accomplished.

#### Stage 0:
For the first task, we have made public the assignment for basic knowledge of the financial world. The assignment is not based on the deep financial jargons, but enough of what is actually required to gain a conceptual understanding.
For the second task, do read the readme file in the corresponding folder.

#### Stage 1:
Now let's confuse ourselves with regression and classification. This is a step for further complicated machine learning models, hence an understanding is important to relate the learning with the application into the markets. Thus, read the readme.txt in task3 and complete the assignments in the directory task3.
